# Broker — Overview

## Purpose

Public-facing HTTP API gateway. It is the only Logwolf service reachable from the internet (via Caddy). It:

- Authenticates API keys and routes write requests to RabbitMQ
- Proxies read/delete requests to the Logger service via RPC
- Exposes internal admin routes for the dashboard (API key management, settings, metrics)

## HTTP routes

### Public routes (Bearer token required)

| Method   | Path          | Scope    | Description                              |
| -------- | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/logs`       | `ingest` | Submit a single log event (async, 202)   |
| `POST`   | `/logs/batch` | `ingest` | Submit up to 1000 events at once         |
| `GET`    | `/logs`       | `read`   | Retrieve events (RPC → Logger → MongoDB) |
| `GET`    | `/logs/{id}`  | `read`   | Retrieve one event of the key's project  |
| `DELETE` | `/logs`       | `delete` | Delete matching events (RPC → Logger)    |

A key without the route's scope gets 403.

Both log reads, `GET /logs` and the dashboard's `GET /projects/{id}/logs`, take `page` and `pageSize` from the query (`paginationFromQuery`). A missing one means the first page, or 20 logs. One that is given must be a whole number within `data.PaginationParams.Validate`'s bounds: `page` from 1 to 1,000,000, `pageSize` from 1 to 100 (`data.MaxPageSize`). Anything else is a 400 rather than a quiet fallback, so a client asking for 1000 logs learns it did not get them. The logger enforces the same bounds in `AllLogs`, whoever calls it: a page is decoded whole in the logger and sent back in one RPC reply, so an unbounded one could load a project's every log into memory.

### Internal routes (`X-Internal-Secret` header required)

Not reachable from the internet: Caddy forwards only the public routes above and the health checks, and `caddy_test.go` fails if the `Caddyfile` would forward any of these, or stop forwarding a public one.

Everything that acts on one project is under `/projects/{id}`.

| Method   | Path                             | Access | Description                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/projects`                      | —      | Projects the caller belongs to, with `role`          |
| `POST`   | `/projects`                      | —      | Create a project, owned by the caller                |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}`                 | member | Get one project                                      |
| `PATCH`  | `/projects/{id}`                 | owner  | Rename a project (the slug stays)                    |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/{id}`                 | owner  | Delete a project and everything under it             |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/members`         | member | List members                                         |
| `POST`   | `/projects/{id}/members`         | owner  | Add a member                                         |
| `PATCH`  | `/projects/{id}/members/{login}` | owner  | Change a member's `role` (owner or member)           |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/{id}/members/{login}` | owner  | Remove a member                                      |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/logs`            | member | List a project's events (paginated)                  |
| `POST`   | `/projects/{id}/logs`            | member | Submit an event to a project (async, 202)            |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/logs/{logID}`    | member | Get one event                                        |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/{id}/logs/{logID}`    | member | Delete one event                                     |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/keys`            | member | List API keys                                        |
| `POST`   | `/projects/{id}/keys`            | member | Create an API key; `scopes` default: ingest          |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/{id}/keys/{keyID}`    | member | Revoke an API key; another project's is a 404        |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/retention`       | member | Get retention (`{"days": n}`)                        |
| `PATCH`  | `/projects/{id}/retention`       | member | Update retention; lowering it is owner-only (below)  |
| `GET`    | `/projects/{id}/metrics`         | member | Usage analytics                                      |

Internal routes also require `X-User-Login`; project access is checked against
that login on every call. `requireUserLogin` lowercases it first, as memberships
are stored: GitHub logins are case-insensitive.

Every route that acts on a project denies access the same way (`access.go`):

- **404** if the project does not exist, or the id is not an ObjectID;
- **403** if it exists and the caller is not a member, or is a member on an owner-only route.

`authorizeProject` is that rule. It costs one logger call, `RPCServer.ProjectAccess`, which answers both whether the project exists and the caller's role. Every `/projects/{id}/...` route gets it from the `requireProject(anyMember|ownerOnly)` middleware, so `routes.go` states each route's access level. The middleware also hands the handler the checked project (with its canonical lower-case id) and the logger connection it checked over, which the handler reuses and the middleware closes. No route takes a project id from the query or the body.

Creating a project is one logger call: the logger writes the project and the
caller's owner membership in one transaction, so a failure leaves no project
behind that nobody could reach. Slugs are display labels, fixed at creation and
not unique, so creating a project never reveals that someone else's has the same
one.

Renaming or deleting a project and adding, removing or changing the role of a
member are owner-only. A project always keeps one owner: removing or demoting the last one is a 400
(`cannot remove the last owner` / `cannot demote the last owner`). An owner may
demote themselves while another owner remains, which is how a project changes
hands: promote the new owner, then step down.

Any member may raise a project's retention, but only an owner may lower it:
`UpdateRetention` reads the current value first and answers 403 when
`data.LowersRetention` says the new one is shorter (0, forever, is the longest).
Lowering it is a bulk delete, as the next cleanup pass drops everything outside
the new window. Creating and revoking API keys stays open to every member.

The `/projects/{id}/logs` routes are the dashboard's way into events. They do the
same work as the public `/logs` routes, but take the project from the path and
check the caller's membership instead of reading it off an API key — the
dashboard authenticates as a user and has no key of its own to scope it. An id
that belongs to another project is a 404, never another project's event.

### Errors from the logger

`net/rpc` turns the logger's errors into plain strings, so `rpcerrors.go` reads
the cause back out of the message in one place (`classifyRPCError`) and
`rpcErrorJSON` maps it to a status, replacing Mongo's wording with a message of
the handler's choosing:

| Cause                                                  | Status | Example                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Unique index violation (`E11000`)                      | 409    | Adding an existing member                          |
| No document matched, or the id is not a valid ObjectID | 404    | A malformed project id on any project-scoped route |
| `data.ErrKeyNotFound`                                  | 404    | Revoking a key that does not exist                 |
| `data.ErrLastOwner`                                    | 400    | Removing or demoting the last owner                |
| Anything else                                          | 500    | The logger or MongoDB failed                       |

Retention days are checked against `data.ValidRetentionDays` before the logger is
called. A missing `days` is a 400 as well, rather than 0 (keep forever).

### Health

| Method | Path      | Description                                                                             |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/ping`   | Liveness (no auth)                                                                      |
| `GET`  | `/health` | RabbitMQ and logger status (no auth); 503 unless both are `up`                          |

The logger check calls `RPCServer.Status`. It is `down` if the logger cannot be reached or does not answer within 2s, and `degraded` while the logger's startup tasks are failing and being retried; the error carries the logger's last startup error.

## Authentication

Two middleware layers:

- **`requireAPIKey`** — validates the `Authorization: Bearer lw_...` token through the logger (`RPCServer.ValidateAPIKey`); results are cached with TTL + rate limiting so the hot path does not make an RPC call per request. A cached key is evicted as soon as it is revoked (`DELETE /projects/{id}/keys/{keyID}`) or its project deleted (`DELETE /projects/{id}`), via `forgetCachedKeys`, so it stops working at once rather than after the 60s TTL. A validation already in flight during an eviction is not cached, since it may have read the key before the revoke. The eviction is local: a second broker replica would keep its entry until it expires. The key cache and the per-IP failure counters are each capped at 10,000 entries. A background sweep deletes expired entries every minute, so a flood of bogus keys from many addresses cannot grow them without bound.
  - **`requireScope`** — runs after it, per public route, and refuses with 403 a key that lacks the route's scope. Keys can end up in browser bundles, so `POST /projects/{id}/keys` gives a key only `ingest` unless the caller asks for `read` or `delete`. A key created before scopes existed has none stored and is read back with all three, so it keeps working. The key cache holds the scopes too.
- **`requireInternalSecret`** — validates the `X-Internal-Secret` header; used exclusively by the dashboard backend.

## Write path

```
Client → POST /logs → requireAPIKey → publish to RabbitMQ → confirmed → 202 Accepted
```

A 202 means RabbitMQ holds the event on disk (`event.Emitter`, `events.go`):

- **Persistent** messages on the durable `logwolf_logs` queue survive a RabbitMQ restart.
- **Publisher confirms:** the broker answers only once RabbitMQ has confirmed every event of the request, within 10s. If it does not, the answer is **503**, which the SDK retries. A batch is published on one channel and confirmed as a whole; one that fails part-way may have queued some events, so a retry can store those twice.
- **The broker declares the queue** and its `log.*` binding at start, as the listener does. The exchange drops what no queue is bound for, so before, events sent before the listener had first run went nowhere.
- **Reconnects:** the emitter dials RabbitMQ again once its connection has closed, as it does when RabbitMQ restarts. The request that finds it closed tries once; `/health` reconnects too.

Every event's severity is normalized before anything is published (`data.NormalizeSeverity`): trimmed and lower-cased, so `ERROR` is stored as `error`, which is what the metrics count. A severity that is not `info`, `warning`, `error` or `critical`, a missing one included, is a **400** naming it (`event N: …` within a batch), and nothing of the request is queued. Events stored before this keep the casing they were sent with; they are not migrated.

Events are published to the `logs_topic` exchange with routing key `log.<severity>` (`data.SeverityRoutingKey`): `log.info`, `log.warning`, `log.error` or `log.critical`. A batch publishes each event under its own. The broker has no MongoDB client at all: API keys, like everything else it stores or reads, go through the logger's RPC methods.

## Read path

```
Client    → GET /logs                   → requireAPIKey       → RPC call to Logger:5001 → response
Dashboard → GET /projects/{id}/logs     → requireProject      → RPC call to Logger:5001 → response
```

## Environment variables

| Variable              | Default                       | Description                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `RABBITMQ_URL`        | `amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq` | RabbitMQ connection string     |
| `BROKER_PORT`         | `80`                          | HTTP listen port               |
| `LOGGER_RPC_ADDR`     | `logger:5001`                 | Logger RPC address             |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` | —                             | Shared secret for dashboard    |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES`     | — (trust no one)              | See below                      |

`TRUSTED_PROXIES` is a comma-separated list of IPs and CIDR ranges. A request from one of them is attributed to the right-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry that is not itself trusted (`clientIP` in `clientip.go`); any other request is attributed to its peer address, and its `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored. The failed-auth rate limiter counts per that address. Behind Caddy it must cover Caddy, or every internet client shares Caddy's counter and ten bad keys from anyone lock out all SDK clients for a minute. `docker-compose.yml` trusts the private ranges, which is safe only while the broker publishes no port. An entry that is not an IP or range stops the broker at start.
