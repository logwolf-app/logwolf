# Architecture overview

Logwolf is a small distributed system. This page explains how the pieces fit together and why they're structured the way they are.

## Services

**Caddy** is the only service that faces the internet. It terminates TLS and routes traffic: the Broker's public routes (`/api/logs`, `/api/logs/*`, `/api/health`, `/api/ping`) go to the Broker, any other path under `/api/` is a 404, and everything else goes to the Frontend. The Broker's dashboard routes are never forwarded: the Frontend reaches them over the internal network. Nothing else is exposed on the host.

**Broker** is the HTTP API gateway, written in Go using the `chi` router. All SDK traffic enters here. It validates API keys, pushes log events to RabbitMQ asynchronously, and proxies read requests to the Logger via RPC. The Broker responds `202 Accepted` to write requests immediately — before the event hits the database. It exposes two write endpoints: `POST /logs` for single events and `POST /logs/batch` for batched delivery (max 1000 events per request).

**RabbitMQ** decouples ingestion from persistence. The Broker publishes events to a topic exchange (`logs_topic`). The Listener consumes from a durable named queue (`logwolf_logs`), which the Broker declares too, so events are queued even before the Listener first runs. Messages are persistent, and the Broker answers `202` only once RabbitMQ has confirmed them, so an accepted event survives a Listener, Logger or RabbitMQ restart.

**Listener** is a background worker that consumes from RabbitMQ and forwards events to the Logger via Go's `net/rpc` over TCP. It handles one message at a time, synchronously, so a clean shutdown always finishes the current message before stopping. A message is acknowledged only once the Logger has stored it; while the Logger is unreachable the Listener retries with back-off and the queue holds the rest, so an outage delays events rather than losing them.

**Logger** is the only service with direct access to MongoDB. It runs a Go RPC server on port `5001` and handles all reads and writes. The Logger also manages the retention TTL index and runs metric aggregations via a MongoDB `$facet` pipeline.

**Frontend** is a React Router v7 SSR application. It authenticates users via GitHub OAuth, reads data from the Broker using an internal secret header, and instruments itself with the Logwolf SDK (sampling at 50% for normal events, 100% for errors).

**MongoDB** stores all log events in the `logs` collection within the `logs` database. A TTL index on `created_at` enforces the retention policy. MongoDB and RabbitMQ are on an internal Docker network — they are not reachable from the host.

## Write path

When your application calls `logwolf.capture(event)`:

1. The SDK enqueues the event in memory and returns immediately.
2. When the queue reaches `maxBatchSize` or `flushIntervalMs` elapses, the SDK sends a `POST /api/logs/batch` request with an `Authorization: Bearer lw_...` header. Failed sends are retried according to `retryDelaysMs`.
3. Caddy forwards the request to the Broker.
4. The Broker validates the API key — checking an in-memory 60-second cache first, then MongoDB on a miss.
5. The Broker publishes each event in the batch to RabbitMQ and returns `202 Accepted`.
6. The Listener picks up the messages from the durable queue.
7. The Listener calls `RPCServer.LogInfo` on the Logger over TCP.
8. The Logger writes each event to MongoDB.

When `logwolf.create(event)` is used instead, step 1–2 are skipped — the event is sent immediately via `POST /api/logs` and the call awaits the server response.

The HTTP response comes back before the database write completes, but after RabbitMQ has the event on disk. This keeps ingestion latency low and protects your application from any slowness in the persistence layer.

## Read path

When the dashboard loads the events list:

1. The Frontend SSR loader calls the Broker's `GET /projects/{id}/logs` directly, on the internal network, with `X-Internal-Secret` and the signed-in user in `X-User-ID` (their GitHub user ID) and `X-User-Login`.
2. The Broker checks the user belongs to the project, dials the Logger on `logger:5001` and calls `RPCServer.GetLogs`.
3. The Logger queries MongoDB with pagination and returns the results.
4. The Broker serialises the result to JSON and returns it to the Frontend.

Every read hits MongoDB directly. There is no read cache.

## Authentication

Logwolf uses two separate authentication mechanisms for two different surfaces.

**API keys** protect the SDK ingestion endpoints (`POST /api/logs`, `GET /api/logs`, `DELETE /api/logs`). Keys use a `lw_` prefix, are stored bcrypt-hashed in MongoDB, and are validated in `requireAPIKey` middleware on the Broker. Validation looks keys up by their stored 10-character prefix, so it runs one bcrypt compare, not one per key. A 60-second in-memory cache avoids a database hit on every request. Revoking a key, or deleting its project, evicts it from the cache at once, so it stops working immediately. With more than one Broker replica, only the one that handled the revoke evicts it; the others keep it until the entry expires. Failed attempts are rate-limited per client IP: 10 failures within 60 seconds triggers a `429`. Ingestion is rate-limited per key too, by a token bucket sized from the plan of the key's project (no limit self-hosted): events past it are refused with a `429` and a `Retry-After`, so one project's flood cannot fill the queue every project shares. Each organization also has a monthly event quota, from its plan, which the broker counts per organization: past it, events are refused with a `429` whose `code` is `quota_exceeded` (the rate's is `rate_limited`) until the month is over. Behind Caddy, the client IP is read from `X-Forwarded-For`, believed only from the peers listed in `TRUSTED_PROXIES`. 

**GitHub OAuth** protects the dashboard. The Frontend handles the OAuth callback, validates the user against a configured allow-list (`LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` or `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS`), and sets a signed HTTP-only session cookie. Dashboard routes are protected at the layout level via `requireAuth`.

Internal Frontend → Broker calls (key management, settings, metrics) use a shared `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` header and never go through the API key path.

## Data model

Each log event is stored as a document in MongoDB with this shape:

```go
type LogEntry struct {
    ID        string    // MongoDB ObjectID as hex string
    Name      string    // Event name, e.g. "checkout.completed"
    Data      string    // JSON payload, stored as a string
    Severity  string    // "info" | "warning" | "error" | "critical"
    Tags      []string
    Duration  int       // milliseconds, measured by the SDK
    CreatedAt time.Time
    UpdatedAt time.Time
}
```

The `Data` field is currently stored as a serialised JSON string rather than a BSON subdocument. This means MongoDB cannot index into the event payload. Migrating to a BSON embedded document is planned and will unlock payload-level querying.

```

The `internal: true` Docker network flag blocks all external routing. MongoDB and RabbitMQ cannot be reached from outside the host, even if their ports were accidentally exposed.
