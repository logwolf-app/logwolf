# JS SDK reference

The Logwolf JS SDK ships as `@logwolf/client-js` on npm. It handles event creation, sampling, and delivery to your Logwolf instance. Its source lives in [logwolf-app/client-js](https://github.com/logwolf-app/client-js).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @logwolf/client-js
```

### Compatibility

| SDK   | Logwolf server                                                                    |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.x   | The multi-tenancy release or later: `getOne` uses its `GET /logs/:id` route       |
| 1.x   | Any; `getOne` searches only the newest page of events                             |

Upgrading from 1.x? See the [changelog](https://github.com/logwolf-app/client-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md): `getOne` and `getAll`'s pagination changed.

## Initialisation

```ts
import Logwolf from '@logwolf/client-js';

const logwolf = new Logwolf({
	url: 'https://logs.your-domain.com/api/',
	apiKey: process.env.LOGWOLF_API_KEY,
	sampleRate: 0.5,
	errorSampleRate: 1,
	flushIntervalMs: 5000,
	maxBatchSize: 20,
	maxQueueSize: 500,
	retryDelaysMs: [1000, 3000, 10000],
	requestTimeoutMs: 10000,
});
```

Configuration is validated at construction time using Zod. If a required field is missing or malformed, the constructor throws immediately.

### Configuration options

| Option             | Type       | Required | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`              | `string`   | ✅       | Base URL of your Logwolf instance, e.g. `https://your-domain.com/api`. Trailing slash is optional — the client normalises it internally. Must be a valid URL. |
| `apiKey`           | `string`   | ✅       | API key generated from the dashboard. Must start with `lw_` and be at least 10 characters.                     |
| `flushIntervalMs`  | `number`   | ✅       | How often (ms) the queue is flushed automatically.                                                              |
| `maxBatchSize`     | `number`   | ✅       | Flush immediately when the queue reaches this many events, without waiting for the interval.                    |
| `maxQueueSize`     | `number`   | ✅       | Maximum number of events to hold in memory. When exceeded, the oldest event is dropped.                         |
| `retryDelaysMs`    | `number[]` | ✅       | Delays between retry attempts on failed sends. Length determines retry count. Use `[]` to disable retries.      |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | `number`   | ✅       | Abort a fetch after this many milliseconds.                                                                     |
| `sampleRate`       | `number`   | —        | Fraction of `info` and `warning` events to send. `1` = all, `0.5` = half, `0` = none. Defaults to sending all. |
| `errorSampleRate`  | `number`   | —        | Fraction of `error` events to send. `critical` events always bypass sampling. Defaults to sending all.          |
| `onDropped`        | `function` | —        | Called when events are dropped. Signature: `(events: LogwolfEvent[], reason: string) => void`.                  |

## Creating events

Events are created using the `LogwolfEvent` class. Instantiating a `LogwolfEvent` starts a stopwatch — the duration is automatically computed when the event is serialised.

```ts
import { LogwolfEvent } from '@logwolf/client-js';

const event = new LogwolfEvent({
	name: 'checkout.completed',
	severity: 'info',
	tags: ['payments', 'stripe'],
});
```

### Constructor options

| Option     | Type                                           | Required | Description                                                                             |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | `string`                                       | ✅       | Event identifier. Use a consistent naming convention, e.g. `resource.action`.           |
| `severity` | `'info' \| 'warning' \| 'error' \| 'critical'` | ✅       | Event severity level.                                                                   |
| `tags`     | `string[]`                                     | ✅       | Array of tags for grouping and filtering. Duplicates are removed at serialisation time. |
| `data`     | `Record<string, unknown>`                      | —        | Initial key/value payload. Can be extended with `.set()`.                               |

### Attaching data

```ts
event.set('userId', '123');
event.set('orderId', 'ord_abc');
event.set('amount', 9900);
```

### Adding tags

```ts
event.addTag('checkout');
event.addTag('stripe');
```

### Retrieving data

```ts
const userId = event.get('userId');
```

### Changing severity

```ts
event.setSeverity('warning');
```

## Sending events

### `capture(event)`

Enqueues an event for batched delivery. This is the method you'll use in most cases.

```ts
logwolf.capture(event);
```

`capture()` is **synchronous** — it enqueues the event and returns immediately. Delivery happens in the background. It returns `true` if the event was accepted into the queue, `false` if it was dropped by sampling or because the queue was full.

Sampling behaviour:

- `info` and `warning` events are sampled at `sampleRate`
- `error` events are sampled at `errorSampleRate`
- `critical` events always bypass sampling and are always sent

Events are delivered to the server in batches, either when `maxBatchSize` is reached or when the flush interval fires.

### `create(event)`

Sends an event immediately, bypassing both sampling and the queue. Awaitable — resolves when the server has acknowledged the event.

```ts
await logwolf.create(event);
```

Use this when you need guaranteed, synchronous delivery — for example, in a process exit handler.

### `flush()`

Drains the queue immediately. If a background flush is already in progress, waits for it to complete before sending any remaining events.

```ts
await logwolf.flush();
```

Call this before process exit or page unload to avoid losing buffered events.

### `destroy()`

Stops the background flush interval. Call this for clean Node.js shutdown or in test teardown. Any events still in the queue will be lost — call `flush()` first if you need to drain them.

```ts
await logwolf.flush();
logwolf.destroy();
```

## Duration tracking

`LogwolfEvent` acts as a stopwatch. The duration is measured from object instantiation to the moment the event is stopped.

- `capture()` stops the clock at **enqueue time** — before the event is sent to the server.
- `create()` stops the clock immediately before sending.
- You can also stop the clock manually by calling `event.stop()` before either method.

`stop()` is idempotent — calling it more than once is a no-op; the first call wins.

```ts
const event = new LogwolfEvent({
	name: 'db.query',
	severity: 'info',
	tags: ['database'],
});

const result = await db.query('SELECT ...');

event.set('rows', result.length);
logwolf.capture(event); // duration = time since event was instantiated
```

The `duration` field appears in milliseconds in the dashboard and in the event payload.

## Retrieving events

### `getAll(pagination?)`

Fetches a paginated list of events from your Logwolf instance.

```ts
const events = await logwolf.getAll({ page: 1, pageSize: 20 });
```

Returns an array of `LogwolfEventData` objects. Without `pagination` you get the first 20. `pageSize` is a whole number up to `MAX_PAGE_SIZE` (100) and `page` one up to `MAX_PAGE` (1,000,000), both exported; `getAll` throws a `ZodError` for anything else before sending a request.

### `getOne(id)`

Fetches a single event by ID, from the server's `GET /logs/:id`, whatever its age. Resolves to `undefined` when the key's project has no event with that ID, including one that belongs to another project. Needs a key with the `read` scope, and a Logwolf server with that route.

```ts
const event = await logwolf.getOne('66f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1');
```

## Deleting events

### `delete(dto)`

Deletes an event by ID.

```ts
await logwolf.delete({ id: '66f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1' });
```

## Event severity guide

The server stores these four only, lower-cased. A client that calls the HTTP API directly may send them in any case (`ERROR` is stored as `error`); any other value is refused with a `400`.

| Severity   | When to use                                                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`     | Normal operations — user actions, background jobs, feature usage                                    |
| `warning`  | Something unexpected happened but the operation succeeded — retries, degraded paths, unusual inputs |
| `error`    | The operation failed — exceptions, failed requests, unhandled states                                |
| `critical` | Requires immediate attention — data corruption, security events, service outages                    |

`critical` events bypass sampling entirely and are always delivered.

## Usage patterns

### Wrapping an async operation

```ts
async function processOrder(orderId: string) {
	const event = new LogwolfEvent({
		name: 'order.process',
		severity: 'info',
		tags: ['orders'],
		data: { orderId },
	});

	try {
		const result = await doWork(orderId);
		event.set('result', result.status);
		logwolf.capture(event);
	} catch (err) {
		event.setSeverity('error');
		event.set('error', err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err));
		logwolf.capture(event);
	}
}
```

### Capturing errors in a global handler

```ts
process.on('uncaughtException', async (err) => {
	const event = new LogwolfEvent({
		name: 'process.uncaughtException',
		severity: 'critical',
		tags: ['process'],
	});
	event.set('error', err.message);
	event.set('stack', err.stack);
	await logwolf.create(event);
});
```

### Next.js middleware

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
import Logwolf, { LogwolfEvent } from '@logwolf/client-js';

const logwolf = new Logwolf({
	url: process.env.LOGWOLF_URL!,
	apiKey: process.env.LOGWOLF_API_KEY!,
	sampleRate: 0.1,
	errorSampleRate: 1,
	flushIntervalMs: 5000,
	maxBatchSize: 20,
	maxQueueSize: 500,
	retryDelaysMs: [1000, 3000, 10000],
	requestTimeoutMs: 10000,
});

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
	const event = new LogwolfEvent({
		name: 'http.request',
		severity: 'info',
		tags: ['http'],
		data: {
			method: request.method,
			path: request.nextUrl.pathname,
		},
	});

	logwolf.capture(event);

	return NextResponse.next();
}
```

## TypeScript types

The SDK is written in TypeScript and ships with full type definitions.

```ts
import type {
	LogwolfConfig, // Constructor options for `new Logwolf()`
	LogwolfEventDTO, // Constructor options for `new LogwolfEvent()`
	LogwolfEventData, // Shape of events returned by `getAll()` / `getOne()`
	Severity, // 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical'
	Pagination, // { page: number; pageSize: number }
	DeleteLogwolfEventDTO, // { id: string }
} from '@logwolf/client-js';
```
