## Project selection

Every protected page except `/projects/new` is scoped to one project, held in the
session as `currentProjectID`. The layout loader owns that value: it re-points the
session when the stored project is gone or the user lost access to it, and it sends
a user with no projects at all to `/projects/new` — the one page that renders
without a current project.

Switching projects is a POST to `/projects/switch`, which re-checks membership
server-side before writing the session. The sidebar switcher and the `/projects`
list both go through it.

Pages take the project from the session and nowhere else — never from the URL or
a hidden form field. Every loader and action calls `getCurrentProjectID()` and
passes the result to the API client, so the redirect back from
`/projects/switch` revalidates them straight into the new project.

That includes `/events`, which reads and writes through the broker's
`/projects/:id/logs` routes rather than the SDK. The SDK authenticates with the
dashboard's own `API_KEY`, which belongs to one fixed project — it could never
follow the switcher, and it would have shown every user that project's events.
`lib/logwolf.ts` keeps using it for what it is: the dashboard's own telemetry.

## Project settings

`/projects/:id/settings` holds everything scoped to one project: its name, the
retention window, the member list, and deletion. Both the loader and the action
resolve the `:id` against the caller's own project list, so a project the user
does not belong to sends them back to `/projects` instead of surfacing a 403.

Every section except retention is owner-only — the broker enforces that as well,
so the role checks in the route are there to keep a stale tab from producing a
bare "forbidden". Retention is open to any member, but only upwards: shortening
it makes the next cleanup pass delete everything outside the new window, so a
member sees the shorter options disabled, and the action checks the stored value
with `lowersRetention` (`app/lib/retention.ts`) before calling the broker. API
keys are not project settings; any member may create and revoke them on `/keys`.
Owners change a member's role from a select in the members
table; the last owner shows a plain badge instead, since the broker would refuse
to demote them. Deleting a project clears `currentProjectID` when it was the
one in session and returns to `/projects`, where the layout takes over.

Adding a member checks the login first (`checkInvitee` in
`app/lib/allowlist.server.ts`). A login GitHub does not know, or an
organization, is refused. Otherwise the member is added under GitHub's casing,
with a warning when the allowlist does not clear them.

Org membership is asked with the inviting owner's own GitHub token, kept from
sign-in. GitHub shows private members only to someone in the org, so an owner in
an allowed org gets a definite answer for its private members too. Where GitHub
will not answer the owner (they are not in that org, or the session predates
tokens being kept, or the token was revoked), the check falls back to public
membership, and a user it cannot clear gets a warning that allows for private
membership. The same warning, worded for it, covers GitHub being unreachable or
rate-limited: that never blocks an owner.

## Authentication

1. User initiates login via GitHub OAuth 2.0.
2. On callback, the server checks the GitHub user against `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` and
   `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` (`lib/allowlist.server.ts`). Access is denied by default: the login
   must be in the users list or belong to an org in the orgs list. With both lists empty nobody can
   sign in, and the server logs an error at startup. Both lists are parsed like the logger's
   `ParseGithubLogins` (trimmed, lowercased, blanks and duplicates dropped), and a failed org lookup
   denies the sign-in.
3. A session cookie is issued for subsequent requests (React Router's cookie session: signed with
   `SESSION_SECRET`, not encrypted, so readable by whoever holds it). It keeps the user's GitHub
   OAuth token too, for the invite check, **sealed** with AES-256-GCM under a key derived from
   `SESSION_SECRET` (`lib/token.server.ts`). The token carries the scopes sign-in asks for,
   `read:user read:org`, and goes nowhere but `api.github.com`. Changing `SESSION_SECRET` signs
   everyone out and makes old tokens unreadable.
4. All protected routes validate the session server-side before rendering.

CSRF tokens are required on all mutating form submissions.

## API communication

`lib/api.ts` exports an `Api` class that calls Broker's **internal routes** using the `X-Internal-Secret` header (sourced from `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`). The frontend never calls the public Broker routes — those are for SDK clients only.

The client is request-scoped: `createApi(login)` takes the GitHub login of the signed-in user and sends it as `X-User-Login` on every call, which is what the broker checks project membership against. Project-scoped methods (`getKeys`, `createKey`, `deleteKey`, `getMetrics`, `getRetention`, `updateRetention`, `getLogs`, `getLog`, `createLog`, `deleteLog`, and everything under `projects`) take the project id as an argument, so a route has to state which project it means; they all call the broker's `/projects/{id}/...` routes.

Event payloads come back exactly as the broker stores them, so `getLogs`/`getLog` decode them with the SDK's own `LogwolfEventSchema` — `data` back into an object, timestamps back into `Date`s. Pages therefore keep working with `LogwolfEventData`, unchanged by the move off the SDK transport.

## Error tracking

`lib/logwolf.ts` initialises the Logwolf JS SDK. `root.tsx` wires it into the React Router middleware so every navigation and unhandled error is captured automatically.

## Environment variables

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `API_URL`                      | Broker base URL (e.g. `http://broker/`)                              |
| `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`          | Shared secret for internal Broker routes                             |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`             | GitHub OAuth app client ID                                           |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`         | GitHub OAuth app client secret                                       |
| `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` | Comma-separated list of allowed GitHub usernames                     |
| `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS`  | Comma-separated list of GitHub orgs whose members are allowed        |
| `SESSION_SECRET`               | Signs session cookies; the key sealing GitHub tokens derives from it |

## Development commands

```bash
pnpm run dev       # Vite dev server (hot reload)
pnpm run build     # react-router build → build/
pnpm run typecheck # react-router typegen + tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint      # oxlint
pnpm test          # vitest, single run
```

## Tests

Vitest runs in node (`vitest.config.ts`) and covers the server side, where access and project scoping are decided:

- **Libraries:** the allowlist and invite check, retention, and `lib/api.ts`, whose tests check every project-scoped call names the project in the path, sends the internal secret and the user's login, and encodes what it puts in a path.
- **Route loaders and actions** (`*.test.ts` next to each route), called the way React Router calls them. Requests carry a real signed session cookie, built by the helpers in `app/test/routes.ts`, so sessions and CSRF are the real code. Only the broker client (`createApi`) is replaced, by `fakeApi`, whose every method rejects unless the test stubs it, and GitHub's API is stubbed on `fetch` where a test needs it.

Covered: the layout's session repair and first-project redirect, the project switcher (membership, CSRF, open redirects), project settings (owner-only intents, retention, invites, delete), keys and event pages (always the project in session, whatever the form says). Components are not rendered in tests.
