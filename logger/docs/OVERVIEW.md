# Logger — Overview

## Purpose

The only Logwolf service with direct MongoDB access. All reads, writes, and deletes on log data go through Logger. It exposes two servers:

- An **RPC server** (port 5001) used by Broker and Listener to perform storage operations.
- A minimal **HTTP server** (port 80) used only for health checks.

## RPC interface

The RPC server is exposed via Go's standard `net/rpc` package on TCP port 5001.

| Method                | Input               | Output       | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPCServer.LogInfo`   | `RPCLogPayload`     | `string`     | Insert one log entry, unless its project is gone   |
| `RPCServer.GetLogs`   | `QueryParams`       | `[]LogEntry` | Query logs with optional filtering and pagination  |
| `RPCServer.GetLog`    | `RPCLogEntryFilter` | `LogEntry`   | Fetch one entry by id within a project             |
| `RPCServer.DeleteLog` | `RPCLogEntryFilter` | `int64`      | Delete matching log entries; returns count deleted |

`RPCServer.ProjectAccess` (`RPCProjectAccessArgs` → `ProjectAccess`) answers every Broker access check in one call: whether the project exists, and the login's role in it (empty for a non-member). A malformed project id is an `invalid project ID` error, which the Broker answers as 404.

API keys live here too, so the Broker needs no database of its own:

| Method                     | Input                   | Output                   | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPCServer.ValidateAPIKey` | `RPCValidateAPIKeyArgs` | `RPCValidateAPIKeyReply` | Resolve a plaintext key; unknown or revoked is `Valid` false     |
| `RPCServer.ListAPIKeys`    | `ProjectArgs`           | `[]APIKey`               | A project's keys, newest first                                   |
| `RPCServer.CreateAPIKey`   | `RPCCreateAPIKeyArgs`   | `RPCCreateAPIKeyReply`   | Generate and store a key; the plaintext is returned once         |
| `RPCServer.RevokeAPIKey`   | `RPCRevokeAPIKeyArgs`   | `string`                 | Revoke a key of a project; another project's is `ErrKeyNotFound` |

Replies never carry a key's bcrypt hash. `gob` sends every exported field whatever its `json` tag says, so the logger clears it first.

## HTTP interface

| Method | Path      | Description                                                                                          |
| ------ | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`  | `/ping`   | Liveness — returns 200 OK while the process is up                                                    |
| `GET`  | `/health` | Startup state (`data.LoggerStatus`): 200 once every startup task succeeded, 503 while it is degraded |

The same status is available over RPC as `RPCServer.Status`, which the broker's `/health` asks for.

## Data model

Each log entry stored in MongoDB contains:

| Field        | Type      | Description                     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `_id`        | ObjectID  | MongoDB document ID             |
| `project_id` | ObjectID  | Owning project (`projects._id`) |
| `name`       | string    | Event name                      |
| `data`       | any       | Arbitrary payload               |
| `severity`   | string    | `info`, `warning`, `error` or `critical`; the broker lower-cases it. Events stored before that keep their casing |
| `tags`       | []string  | Searchable tags                 |
| `duration`   | int64     | Duration in milliseconds        |
| `created_at` | time.Time | Timestamp (drives retention)    |
| `updated_at` | time.Time | Last update timestamp           |

`api_keys.project_id`, `settings.project_id` and `project_members.project_id` are ObjectIDs too. RPC arguments carry project ids as hex strings; each RPC method parses them (`parseProjectID`) and refuses a malformed one with a `not a valid ObjectID` error, which the broker answers with 404.

`CreateProject` takes the owner's login with the project, and writes both in one transaction (`CreateProjectWithOwner`). `UpdateProject` renames only: the slug is fixed at creation.

## Retention

Retention is a per-project setting (default 90 days; supported values 30, 60, 90, 180, 365, or 0 for forever). A background loop deletes expired logs project by project every `CLEANUP_INTERVAL`.

Each project gets its own two-minute timeout, so a project with a huge expired set (say, one that just shortened its retention) cannot use up the time of the projects after it in the list. `DeleteExpiredLogs` deletes in batches, so what a project deleted before its timeout stays deleted and the next pass carries on from there.

### Logs of deleted projects

`DeleteProject` does not delete the project's logs itself. There can be millions, and inside the transaction that removes the project they would outlast MongoDB's transaction lifetime limit, so the project could never be deleted. Instead the RPC returns as soon as the project, its keys, settings and members are gone, and hands the project id to the cleanup loop over a small queue. The loop purges its logs in batches (`PurgeProjectLogs`) between passes. If the purge fails, is cut short by shutdown, or the queue is full, the orphan sweep below deletes the rest in a later pass; the project stays deleted either way.

Deleting a project also does not stop every event already addressed to it: the Broker caches API keys for 60 seconds, and events can be waiting in RabbitMQ. Nobody could read those logs, and the retention loop, which walks the existing projects, would never delete them. Two things keep them from piling up:

- `LogInfo` checks that the event's project exists and drops the event with a `project does not exist` error if not. The Listener logs the error and moves on. Project ids seen to exist are cached for a minute, and `DeleteProject` evicts its project from the cache at once, so the check is rarely a database round trip.
- Each cleanup pass also deletes logs whose `project_id` names no project (`DeleteOrphanedLogs`). That catches an event that passed the check just before its project was deleted, or one accepted by another Logger instance whose cache has not expired. It deletes in batches too, with a timeout per batch rather than per pass, so a big deleted project is not cut off every time. Logs with no `project_id`, or an empty one, are left for the startup migration.

Pre-multi-tenancy builds enforced retention with a single global TTL index on `logs.created_at`. That index is dropped on startup — left in place it would keep expiring logs on the old global schedule, overriding whatever each project now has configured.

## Startup migration

Before the RPC server accepts connections, Logger converts every `project_id` in `logs`, `api_keys` and `settings` still stored as a hex string, as builds before ObjectIDs everywhere wrote them, to an ObjectID (`ConvertProjectIDs`). It works project by project in batches of 10,000, so a run cut short keeps its progress. A string that is not hex names no project and is left alone; the orphan sweep deletes such logs. If a settings document exists under both types, the string one is stale and is dropped. Until a startup pass converts everything, the retention cleanup does not run: it looks retention up by ObjectID, and would expire a project whose setting was not converted yet on the 90-day default.

Next, if the `projects` collection still has the unique slug index of earlier builds, Logger sets the `default` flag on the project with slug `default`, which is the one those builds adopted old data into, and drops the index (`MarkDefaultProject`). From then on the Default project is found by that flag, and slugs are free for anyone.

Then it rewrites any `project_members` login that is not lowercase. Membership lookups normalize the login (GitHub logins are case-insensitive), so a row stored as `JDoe` would never match again. Where a project holds one login in several casings, the rows merge into one that keeps the highest role and the oldest join date. Each login merges in its own transaction.

Then it adopts any data written by a pre-multi-tenancy build:

1. Count documents in `logs`, `api_keys`, and `settings` that carry no project ID. If there are none, nothing happens and nothing is logged.
2. Otherwise, find the project with the `default` flag, or create it (name `Default`, slug `default`). A partial unique index lets only one project have the flag.
3. Stamp every orphaned document with that project's ID.
4. Give each owner login (see below) an owner membership on the project, leaving existing memberships alone.
5. Log a summary line with the project ID and the per-collection counts.

Then, on every start and whatever the orphan count, Logger checks that the `Default` project (if there is one) has an owner. If it has none, every owner login gets an owner membership — a plain member on the list is promoted. A `Default` project that already has an owner is left alone, so someone removed from it in the dashboard is not added back.

The owner logins are `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` plus `LOGWOLF_DEFAULT_PROJECT_OWNERS`.

The migration is idempotent — once no orphaned documents remain and `Default` has an owner it is a no-op, so it runs safely on every start. A run that fails partway does not stop the service from booting; the failure is logged as `Migration: FAILED`.

### Failed startup passes

A startup pass is the indexes (`ensureIndexes`) followed by the migration; see `startup.go`. The first pass runs before the RPC server accepts connections. If any step fails, including an index, several of which are unique constraints, Logger still serves, but degraded. It retries the whole pass in the background, 30s after the failure and then doubling up to every 10 minutes, until one succeeds and it logs `Startup: pass N succeeded; no longer degraded`. Every step is idempotent, so a retry picks up where the last one stopped; that includes the owner step, if it failed after the data had moved. The retention cleanup starts as soon as a pass has converted every `project_id`, even if another step still fails.

While degraded, `GET /health` answers 503 with the last error, and so does the broker's public `/api/health`, which reports the logger as `degraded`.

During an upgrade, a Broker that validated an API key just before the migration caches that key's project (still empty at the time) for up to 60 seconds, so reads with it can come back empty until the entry expires.

With no owner logins configured the data still migrates, but the Default project has no owner and nobody can see it in the dashboard. Logger logs a warning on every start while this lasts. To recover, set `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_USERS` or `LOGWOLF_DEFAULT_PROJECT_OWNERS` on Logger and restart it.

Logins allowed only through `LOGWOLF_ALLOWED_GITHUB_ORGS` are not enrolled, because Logger can't see org membership. An org-only deployment names its Default owners in `LOGWOLF_DEFAULT_PROJECT_OWNERS`; those owners then add the rest of the org from the dashboard.

## Graceful shutdown

The HTTP server has a 15-second shutdown timeout. The RPC server closes its TCP listener on signal receipt.

## Key dependencies

| Dependency         | Role                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `mongo-driver`     | Direct MongoDB access               |
| `logwolf-toolbox`  | Shared data models and utilities    |
| `net/rpc` (stdlib) | RPC server (no external dependency) |

## Development

```bash
# Run locally
cd logwolf-server/logger && go run ./cmd/api

# Unit tests
cd logwolf-server/logger && go test ./... -v
```

The project-scoped RPC methods are covered end to end by the integration suite
(`logwolf-server/integration`), which runs the real Logger against MongoDB.

## Relationship to other services

| Service  | Relationship                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broker   | Calls Logger RPC for reads, deletes and API keys              |
| Listener | Calls Logger RPC to persist events from the queue             |
| MongoDB  | Logger is the sole consumer — no other service touches the DB |

## Note on network isolation

Logger runs on the **internal Docker network** only. It is never reachable from the public internet or from Caddy.
